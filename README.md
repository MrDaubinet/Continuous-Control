# Project 2: Continuous Control
## Train an agent to hold a set of balls

![artificial robots][image1]


# Background
Deep Reinforcement Learning is a trending new algorithmic approach to solve complex learning tasks. The purpose of this project is to train an agent to solve real world "Robotic Control Systems" problems like the one below:

![real robots][image2]

But in an artificial environment.


# The Environment

This project is based off of the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.


Udacity created two environment options for this project, one with a single arm and another with twenty arms. After a fair number of attempts trying to master the first environment and alllllllllot! of hyperparameter optimization. I decided to implement the second environment. The barrier for solving the second version of the environment is slightly different, to take into account the presence of many agents. In particular, your agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents).

Specifically,
 * After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent.  * 
 * This yields 20 (potentially different) scores. We then take the average of these 20 scores.
This yields an average score for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

# Methodology

The Experimental setup is as follows:

  1. Setup the Environment.
  2. Establish a baseline with a random walk.
  3. Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm.
  4. Display Results.
  5. Conclusion of Results.
  6. Ideas for future work.

Import the Unity environment and create an env object

env = UnityEnvironment(file_name='location of reacher.exe')
```

```

## 2. Establish a baseline

To evaluate the difficulty of the environment. A random walk was scored before any algorithmic implementation of the reinforcement learning agent was made. This was done by making an agent that selects random actions at each time step.
```python
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=False)[brain_name]     # reset the environment    
states = env_info.vector_observations                  # get the current state (for each agent)
scores = np.zeros(num_agents)                          # initialize the score (for each agent)
while True:
    actions = np.random.randn(num_agents, action_size) # select an action (for each agent)
    actions = np.clip(actions, -1, 1)                  # all actions between -1 and 1
    env_info = env.step(actions)[brain_name]           # send all actions to tne environment
    next_states = env_info.vector_observations         # get next state (for each agent)
    rewards = env_info.rewards                         # get reward (for each agent)
    dones = env_info.local_done                        # see if episode finished
    scores += env_info.rewards                         # update the score (for each agent)
    states = next_states                               # roll over states to next time step
    if np.any(dones):                                  # exit loop if episode finished
        break
print('Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: {}'.format(np.mean(scores)))
```
This resulted in a score of 0.03. This is quite poor when you keep in mind that the implemented agent needs to get a score of 30, consitently for 100 episodes.

## 3. Implemented Algorithm
Due to the nature of the environment being a continuous control problem. The reinforcemenr learning agorithm needs to be able to work in a continuous space. This hard requirement means we have to use a deep learning approach where neural networks are used for continuous function approximation. When considering between Policy-based vs Value-based Methods. Policy-based methods are better suited for continuous action spaces. Udacity suggest using either the [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf), [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf) or [D4PG](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZipzbCb). I chose to implement the [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf), which is describes as an extension of Deep Q-learning to continuous tasks.

I based my code off of [this](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/ddpg-pendulum) repository, an implementation of DDPG with OpenAI Gym's Pendulum environment. 

![Pendulum][image3]

I copied the Actor and Critic models, as [found here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/ddpg-pendulum/model.py), but I adapted the number of hidden unites to 256 and added another layer of batch normalization. I copied the agent code, [found here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/ddpg-pendulum/ddpg_agent.py), then changed it to accomidate 20 environments. 

The ```Agent()``` code can be [found here](https://github.com/MrDaubinet/Continuous-Control/blob/master/agent.py) resulting DDPG algorithm can be seen below:
```python

## 5. Ideas for Future Work
* **Hyperparameter optimization** - Most algorithms can be tweeked to perform better for specific environments when by changeing the various hyper parameters. This could be investigated to find a more effective agent.
* **Priority Experience Replay** - Prioritized experience replay selects experiences based on a priority value that is correlated with the magnitude of error. This replaces the random selection of experiences with an approach that is more intelligent, as described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05952.pdf). 

# Get Started
1. Install Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/). 
2. Create a new evironment from the environment file in this repository with the command 
    ```
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
3. Run ```python main.py```

    Remove the comments in main to train and run the baseline.

4. Watch the agent hold its balls.
